                access.Railay (Thai: ไร่เลย์, pronounced [râj lēː]), also known as Rai Leh, is a small peninsula between the city of Krabi and Ao Nang in Thailand.[1] It is accessible only by boat due to high limestone cliffs cutting off mainland access. These cliffs attract rock climbers from all over the world, but the area is also popular due to its beautiful beaches and quiet relaxing atmosphere. Accommodation ranges from bungalows and medium-priced resorts in East Railay to a collection of luxury resorts focused on West Railay, though one, Royavadee, spans both waterfronts and also has a beachfront restaurant at Ao Phra Nang. The four main areas of Railay consist of Phra Nang, West Railay, East Railay, and Ton Sai. Ton Sai caters to climbers and the backpacker set and is more rustic than the glitz of West Railay and the shops and restaurants of the East Railay boardwalk.

                Railay beach was not severely affected by the tsunami of 26 December 2004.</p>
